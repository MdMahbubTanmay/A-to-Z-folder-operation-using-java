# A to Z Folder Operation in Java

This repository provides comprehensive examples of folder (directory) operations in Java using the `java.nio.file` package. Each Java file demonstrates a specific operation on folders, including creating, reading, copying, moving, renaming, and deleting directories.

## Contents

- **CreateFolder.java**: Create a new directory.
- **ReadFolderContent.java**: List all files and folders in a directory.
- **CopyFolder.java**: Copy a folder to another location.
- **MoveFolder.java**: Move a folder to another location.
- **RenameFolder.java**: Rename a folder.
- **DeleteFolder.java**: Delete a folder.

## Usage

Each file contains a `main` method in the `Test` class illustrating the operation. You can run each file independently to test the respective folder operation.

**Example:**
```java
public class Test {
    public void main() {
        // Folder operation code here
    }
}
```

**Note:**  
- All folder paths in the examples use absolute paths (e.g., `F:/DeveloperTools/Java Learning/New`).  
- Update the paths according to your system before running the code.

## Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher.
- Proper permissions to perform file/folder operations on the specified directories.
